> **‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Version**  
> This library is currently in **alpha**, APIs and behavior may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

A TypeScript/JavaScript library for scraping recipe data from various cooking websites. This is a JavaScript port inspired by the Python [recipe-scrapers](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers) library.

## Features

- üç≥ Extract structured recipe data from cooking websites
- üîç Support for multiple popular recipe sites
- üöÄ Built with TypeScript for better developer experience
- ‚ö° Fast and lightweight using Bun runtime for development and testing
- üß™ Comprehensive test coverage

## Installation

```bash
npm install recipe-scrapers-js
# or
yarn add recipe-scrapers-js
# or
pnpm add recipe-scrapers-js
# or
bun add recipe-scrapers-js
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { getScraper } from 'recipe-scrapers-js'

const html = `<html>The html to scrape...</html>`

// Get a scraper for a specific URL
// This function will throw if a scraper does not exist.
const scraper = getScraper(html, 'https://allrecipes.com/recipe/example')

const recipe = await scraper.toObject()
  
console.log(recipe)
```

## Supported Sites

This library supports recipe extraction from various popular cooking websites. The scraper automatically detects the appropriate parser based on the URL.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (latest version)
- Node.js 18+ (for compatibility)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nerdstep/recipe-scrapers-js.git
cd recipe-scrapers

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Fetch test data
bun run test:data

# Run tests
bun test

# Build the project
bun run build
```

### Scripts

- `bun run build` - Build the library for distribution
- `bun test` - Run the test suite
- `bun run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- `bun run test:data` - Fetch test data from the original Python repository
- `bun run lint` - Run linting and type checking
- `bun run lint:fix` - Fix linting issues automatically

### Adding New Scrapers

1. Create a new scraper class extending `AbstractScraper`
2. Implement the required methods for data extraction
3. Add the scraper to the scrapers registry
4. Write tests using the test data
5. Update documentation as needed

```typescript
import { AbstractScraper } from './abstract-scraper'
import type { RecipeFields } from '@/types/recipe.interface'

export class NewSiteScraper extends AbstractScraper {
  static host() {
    return 'www.newsite.com'
  }

  extractors = {
    ingredients: this.extractIngredients.bind(this),
  }

  protected extractIngredients(): RecipeFields['ingredients'] {
    const items = this.$('.ingredient').map((_, el) =>
      this.$(el).text().trim()
    ).get()

    return new Set(items)
  }
  
  // ... implement other extraction methods
}
```

## Testing

The project uses test data from the original Python recipe-scrapers repository to ensure compatibility and accuracy. Tests are written using Bun's built-in test runner.

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run tests with coverage
bun run test:coverage
```
